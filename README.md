# Quantum-Computing-with-QSharp
A basic set of Q# programs in C# environment to understand certain quantum phenomenon and various algorithms.
This is based on the course in Pluralsight.
I have uploaded on the q# file and the driver program for each topic.

The Grover's Algorithm and Shor's Algorithm are just for reference and have not been implemented
To run the files taken from here, create a project in Visual Studio with the same name of the topic. It should be a Q# Application. Copy paste the Q# program and the Driver code to the project and run the application.
