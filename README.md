# Quantum-Computing-with-QSharp
A basic set of Q# programs in C# environment to understand certain quantum phenomenon and various algorithms.
This is based on the course in Pluralsight.
I have uploaded on the q# file and the driver program for each topic.

The Grover's Algorithm and Shor's Algorithm are just for reference and have not been implemented
